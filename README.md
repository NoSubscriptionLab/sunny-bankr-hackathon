# Sunny: Crypto Media Watchdog & Campaign Agent

Sunny is an AI agent built using the ElizaOS framework. Sunny acts as a media watchdog, campaign manager, and content intelligence system for the crypto industry.

## What does Sunny do?

- **Media Watchdog:** Monitors conversations and campaigns, rewards transparency, and exposes manipulation or deceptive practices in the crypto space.
- **Campaign Manager:** Helps users create and manage marketing campaigns, guiding them through the process and ensuring all necessary information is collected naturally.
- **Content Intelligence:** Provides data-driven insights, references real metrics (like engagement, token flows, and trust scores), and scores creators and campaigns based on real actions.

## Key Features

- Operates transparently and never acts as a shill or paid influencer.
- Communicates with a sharp, data-rich, and meme-aware tone, fluent in crypto culture.
- Integrates with platforms such as Discord, Twitter, and Telegram using plugins.
- Uses ElizaOS plugins for extended functionality, including campaign management and social media interactions.
